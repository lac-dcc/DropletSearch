# Define a Network
# ----------------
# First, we need to define the network with relay frontend API.
# We can load some pre-defined network from :code:`tvm.relay.testing`.
# We can also load models from MXNet, ONNX, PyTorch, and TensorFlow
# (see :ref:`front end tutorials<tutorial-frontend>`).
#
# For convolutional neural networks, although auto-scheduler can work correctly
# with any layout, we found the best performance is typically achieved with NHWC layout.
# We also implemented more optimizations for NHWC layout with the auto-scheduler.
# So it is recommended to convert your models to NHWC layout to use the auto-scheduler.
# You can use :ref:`ConvertLayout <convert-layout-usage>` pass to do the layout conversion in TVM.

# Define the neural network and compilation target.
# If the target machine supports avx512 instructions, replace the
# "llvm -mcpu=core-avx2" with "llvm -mcpu=skylake-avx512"

# Extract Search Tasks
# --------------------
# Next, we extract the search tasks and their weights from a network.
# The weight of a task is the number of appearances of the task's subgraph
# in the whole network.
# By using the weight, we can approximate the end-to-end latency of the network
# as :code:`sum(latency[t] * weight[t])`, where :code:`latency[t]` is the
# latency of a task and :code:`weight[t]` is the weight of the task.
# The task scheduler will just optimize this objective.

#################################################################
# Other Tips
# ----------
# 1. During the tuning, the auto-scheduler needs to compile many programs and
#    extract feature from them. This part is CPU-intensive,
#    so a high-performance CPU with many cores is recommended for faster search.
# 2. You can use :code:`python3 -m tvm.auto_scheduler.measure_record --mode distill -i log.json`
#    to distill the large log file and only save the best useful records.
# 3. You can resume a search from the previous log file. You just need to
#    add a new argument :code:`load_log_file` when creating the task scheduler
#    in function :code:`run_tuning`. Say,
#    :code:`tuner = auto_scheduler.TaskScheduler(tasks, task_weights, load_log_file=log_file)`
# 4. If you have multiple target CPUs, you can use all of them for measurements to
#    parallelize the measurements. Check this :ref:`section <tutorials-autotvm-scale-up-rpc-tracker>`
#    to learn how to use the RPC Tracker and RPC Server.
#    To use the RPC Tracker in auto-scheduler, replace the runner in :code:`TuningOptions`
#    with :any:`auto_scheduler.RPCRunner`.
